VPEx Connection Manager:

* Improve openvpn process handling
  Right now, the VPEx Connection manager basically runs openvpn in a separate
  shell process.  This means that its output is relegated to a DOS box
  (and in fact is completely hidden on the Mac).  Also the way we stop
  openvpn is kludgy (basically we run a shell script/batch file that
  killall's it).  We should really internalize the handling of the
  openvpn process, basically using the wxWidgets equivalent of popen(),
  etc. so that we can capture the output of openvpn and direct it to the
  (currently mostly useless) Log window.  Also if we are managing the
  processes, we can stop the openvpn process ourselves.
